# Navier-Stokes Self-Similar Blowup Classification

Research program attacking the Millennium Prize Problem via exhaustive classification
of self-similar singularity profiles.

## Core Thesis

**If finite-time blowup occurs, it must be (asymptotically) self-similar.
If we can rule out all self-similar profiles, we prove global regularity.**

## Status

- Phase: Foundation Building
- Current Focus: Deriving and analyzing the self-similar profile equations
