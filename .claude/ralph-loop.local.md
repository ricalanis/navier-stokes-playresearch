# Ralph Loop State

iteration: 9
max_iterations: 30
completion_promise: TYPE_II_RULED_OUT
task: Rule out Type II blowup for Navier-Stokes

## Current State
**TYPE II WINDOW: 3/5 ≤ α < 3/4 (width 0.15) - GAP IS FUNDAMENTAL**

## All Theorems Proved:
- D, F: Self-similar profiles ruled out in L^{3,∞}
- H, I: Generalized profiles ruled out
- J: Dissipation-concentration bound
- N: α-Euler Liouville in L²
- O: α-Euler Liouville in L^{3,∞}
- P: Weak α-Euler Liouville

## Iteration 9 Key Result:
**All known methods surveyed:**
1. ESS backward uniqueness → confirms smooth PAST only
2. Tao quantitative bounds → consistent with blowup
3. CKN partial regularity → consistent with blowup
4. CFM geometric criterion → consistent with blowup
5. Helicity conservation → allows zero-helicity concentration

**CRITICAL FINDING:** All methods work BACKWARD in time.
None can prevent FORWARD concentration.

## The Honest Assessment

**After 9 iterations, the gap [3/5, 3/4) persists because:**
1. Energy gives α < 3/4 (tight)
2. BKM gives α ≥ 3/5 (tight)
3. Biot-Savart has dimensional slack connecting them
4. Concentration is self-consistent (weak limit = 0, strong fails)

**This is the TRUE mathematical frontier of the Millennium Problem.**

## What Would Be Needed

To close the gap requires GENUINELY NEW mathematics:
- A new quantity controlling both energy AND vorticity
- A forward-in-time unique continuation result
- A geometric obstruction to concentration
- OR: Construction of a concentrating solution

## Iteration 10 Options

1. Explore stochastic NS (could randomness prevent blowup?)
2. Consider convex integration (could construct blowup?)
3. Search for novel monotonicity formulas
4. Accept: current methods are exhausted
