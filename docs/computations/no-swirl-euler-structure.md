# Axisymmetric Euler Without Swirl: Structure for Liouville Theorems

## Overview

This document analyzes the structure of axisymmetric Euler equations without swirl to identify mechanisms that could force ancient solutions to vanish. This is central to the Seregin approach for excluding Type II blowup.

---

## 1. Mathematical Setup

### 1.1 Cylindrical Coordinates

Position: $(r, \theta, z)$ where $r \geq 0$, $\theta \in [0, 2\pi)$, $z \in \mathbb{R}$.

**Axisymmetric without swirl:**
- All quantities independent of $\theta$
- No azimuthal velocity component

Velocity field:
$$U = U^r(r,z,t) \, \mathbf{e}_r + U^z(r,z,t) \, \mathbf{e}_z$$

Vorticity:
$$\omega = \omega^\theta(r,z,t) \, \mathbf{e}_\theta = \left(\frac{\partial U^r}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial U^z}{\partial r}\right) \mathbf{e}_\theta$$

### 1.2 Stream Function

Define $\psi(r,z,t)$ such that:
$$U^r = -\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z}, \quad U^z = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}$$

This automatically satisfies incompressibility:
$$\nabla \cdot U = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial(rU^r)}{\partial r} + \frac{\partial U^z}{\partial z} = 0$$

The vorticity relates to the stream function by:
$$\omega^\theta = -\frac{\Delta^* \psi}{r}$$

where the modified Laplacian is:
$$\Delta^* = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2} - \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}$$

---

## 2. Key Evolution Equations

### 2.1 Vorticity Transport

The azimuthal vorticity $\omega^\theta$ satisfies:
$$\frac{\partial \omega^\theta}{\partial t} + (U \cdot \nabla)\omega^\theta = \frac{\omega^\theta}{r} U^r$$

**The right-hand side is the stretching term.** When $U^r < 0$ (inward radial flow), vorticity at that location is compressed.

### 2.2 The Crucial Quantity $\eta = \omega^\theta / r$

Define:
$$\eta = \frac{\omega^\theta}{r}$$

**Fundamental property:** $\eta$ satisfies PURE TRANSPORT with no source:
$$\boxed{\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + (U \cdot \nabla)\eta = 0}$$

**Proof:**
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\omega^\theta}{r}\right) + U \cdot \nabla\left(\frac{\omega^\theta}{r}\right) = \frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{\partial \omega^\theta}{\partial t} + U \cdot \nabla \omega^\theta\right) - \frac{\omega^\theta}{r^2}U^r$$
$$= \frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{\omega^\theta}{r}U^r\right) - \frac{\omega^\theta}{r^2}U^r = 0$$

This is the KEY STRUCTURAL PROPERTY of axisymmetric Euler without swirl.

### 2.3 Stream Function Equation

The stream function satisfies:
$$-\Delta^* \psi = r\omega^\theta = r^2 \eta$$

Given $\eta$, this is a linear elliptic equation for $\psi$.

---

## 3. Conserved Quantities

### 3.1 Material Conservation of $\eta$

Since $\eta$ is purely transported:
$$\eta(x, t) = \eta(\Phi_{-t}(x), 0)$$

where $\Phi_t$ is the flow map generated by $U$.

**Consequence:** Along particle trajectories, $\eta$ is constant.

### 3.2 Integral Invariants

For any function $F: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\int F(\eta) \, r \, dr \, dz = 0$$

**Proof:** Using the transport equation and incompressibility:
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial t}[F(\eta) r] + \nabla \cdot [U F(\eta) r] = F'(\eta) \underbrace{\left[\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + U \cdot \nabla \eta\right]}_{=0} r = 0$$

**Important cases:**
- $F(\eta) = \eta$: Circulation integral (if boundary allows)
- $F(\eta) = \eta^2$: Enstrophy-like quantity
- $F(\eta) = |\eta|^p$: $L^p$ norms of $\eta$ (with weight $r$)

### 3.3 Energy Conservation

Kinetic energy:
$$E = \frac{1}{2}\int |U|^2 r \, dr \, dz = \frac{1}{2}\int \left[(U^r)^2 + (U^z)^2\right] r \, dr \, dz$$

For smooth Euler, $E$ is conserved.

**Relating to stream function:**
$$E = \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{r}\left[(\partial_z \psi)^2 + (\partial_r \psi)^2\right] \frac{1}{r} r \, dr \, dz$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{r}\left|\nabla \psi\right|^2 dr \, dz$$

### 3.4 Helicity

For axisymmetric flows without swirl, helicity vanishes identically:
$$H = \int U \cdot \omega \, dx = 0$$

(since $U$ is meridional and $\omega$ is azimuthal, they are orthogonal)

---

## 4. Ancient Solution Analysis

### 4.1 Definition

An ancient solution exists for $t \in (-\infty, 0]$.

For axisymmetric Euler without swirl:
- $\eta(x,t)$ is defined for all $t \leq 0$
- $\eta(x,t) = \eta(\Phi_{-t}(x), 0)$ relates values at different times

### 4.2 Backward Flow Map Behavior

As $t \to -\infty$, the backward flow $\Phi_{-t}$ traces particles to their ancient origins.

**Question:** Can $\eta$ remain bounded as $t \to -\infty$?

If particles come from infinity: $|\Phi_{-t}(x)| \to \infty$ as $t \to -\infty$.

If $\eta(\cdot, 0)$ has compact support or decays at infinity, then for each fixed $x$:
$$\eta(x,t) = \eta(\Phi_{-t}(x), 0) \to 0 \quad \text{as } t \to -\infty$$

### 4.3 Energy Growth Constraint

Suppose:
$$\int_{B(b)} |U|^2 \, dx = O(b^\gamma) \quad \text{with } \gamma < 1$$

Converting to cylindrical with $B(b) = \{r^2 + z^2 < b^2\}$:
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \int_{r^2+z^2 < b^2} |U|^2 r \, dr \, dz \, d\theta = O(b^\gamma)$$
$$2\pi \int_{r^2+z^2 < b^2} |U|^2 r \, dr \, dz = O(b^\gamma)$$

**Implication for $\psi$:**
Since $|U|^2 \sim |\nabla \psi|^2 / r^2$, we need:
$$\int_{r^2+z^2 < b^2} \frac{|\nabla \psi|^2}{r} \, dr \, dz = O(b^\gamma)$$

For $\gamma < 1$, the energy in balls grows slower than linearly. This is a STRONG constraint.

### 4.4 Constraints on $\eta$

From $-\Delta^* \psi = r^2 \eta$ and the energy bound:

**Scaling analysis:**
If $\psi \sim b^{\alpha_\psi}$ in $B(b)$, then:
- $|\nabla \psi| \sim b^{\alpha_\psi - 1}$
- Energy: $\int |\nabla \psi|^2 / r \sim b^{2\alpha_\psi - 2} \cdot b \cdot b = b^{2\alpha_\psi}$
- Constraint: $2\alpha_\psi < \gamma < 1 \Rightarrow \alpha_\psi < 1/2$

From $\Delta^* \psi \sim -r^2 \eta$:
- $|\Delta^* \psi| \sim b^{\alpha_\psi - 2}$
- $r^2 |\eta| \sim b^{\alpha_\psi - 2}$
- $|\eta| \sim b^{\alpha_\psi - 4}$

For $\alpha_\psi < 1/2$: $|\eta| \sim b^{-\beta}$ with $\beta > 7/2$.

**Conclusion:** The energy bound forces $\eta$ to decay strongly as $b \to \infty$.

## 5. Liouville Mechanisms

### 5.1 Mechanism 1: Trajectory Dispersion

**Claim:** If particles disperse to infinity as $t \to -\infty$, and $\eta$ decays at infinity, then $\eta \equiv 0$.

**Argument:**
1. For ancient solution, $\eta(x,0) = \eta(\Phi_t(x), -t)$ for all $t > 0$
2. If $|\Phi_t(x)| \to \infty$ as $t \to \infty$, and $\eta(\cdot, s) \to 0$ at infinity for each $s$
3. Then $\eta(x,0) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \eta(\Phi_t(x), -t) = 0$

**When does dispersion occur?**
For outward radial flow ($U^r > 0$), particles move away from axis.
For outward axial flow, particles move to $|z| = \infty$.

Energy bound $O(b^\gamma)$ with $\gamma < 1$ suggests decay at infinity forcing dispersion.

### 5.2 Mechanism 2: Enstrophy Control

Define the weighted enstrophy:
$$\mathcal{E} = \int \eta^2 r \, dr \, dz = \int \frac{(\omega^\theta)^2}{r^2} r \, dr \, dz = \int \frac{(\omega^\theta)^2}{r} dr \, dz$$

This is conserved for smooth Euler.

**Constraint from energy:**
Using $\omega^\theta = r\eta$ and $-\Delta^* \psi = r^2 \eta$:

The relation between velocity and $\eta$ is:
$$U^r = -\frac{1}{r}\partial_z \psi, \quad U^z = \frac{1}{r}\partial_r \psi$$

Via Biot-Savart type estimates:
$$|U(x)| \lesssim \int \frac{|\omega^\theta(y)|}{|x-y|} dy$$

If $\mathcal{E} < \infty$ and the energy bound holds, we get constraints on $\eta$.

### 5.3 Mechanism 3: Maximum Principle for $\eta$

Since $\eta$ is transported:
$$\sup_{x, t \leq 0} \eta(x,t) = \sup_x \eta(x,0)$$
$$\inf_{x, t \leq 0} \eta(x,t) = \inf_x \eta(x,0)$$

For ancient solutions with decaying initial data:
- If $\eta(\cdot, 0) \to 0$ at infinity
- And particles come from infinity as $t \to -\infty$
- Then $\eta$ must equal the limit value (0) everywhere

### 5.4 Mechanism 4: Pohozaev-Type Identity

Multiply the stream function equation by $r \partial_r \psi$ and integrate:

$$-\int \Delta^* \psi \cdot r \partial_r \psi \, dr \, dz = \int r^2 \eta \cdot r \partial_r \psi \, dr \, dz$$

**Left side (after integration by parts):**
$$\int |\nabla \psi|^2 r \, dr \, dz + \text{boundary terms}$$

**Right side:**
$$\int r^3 \eta \partial_r \psi \, dr \, dz$$

This gives a constraint relating the energy to moments of $\eta$.

For ancient solutions with specific decay, this can force $\psi = 0$.

## 6. Key Question Analysis

### 6.1 Energy Bound Implications

Given:
$$\int_{B(b)} |U|^2 \, dx = O(b^\gamma), \quad \gamma < 1$$

**Step 1: Decay of $U$**

Energy in shells $B(2b) \setminus B(b)$:
$$\int_{B(2b) \setminus B(b)} |U|^2 \, dx \leq C(2b)^\gamma - Cb^\gamma = Cb^\gamma(2^\gamma - 1)$$

Volume of shell: $\sim b^3$

Average $|U|^2$ in shell: $\sim b^{\gamma - 3}$

For $\gamma < 1$: $|U|^2 \sim b^{\gamma - 3} \to 0$ rapidly as $b \to \infty$.

**Step 2: Decay of $\eta$**

From $-\Delta^* \psi = r^2 \eta$ and $U = \nabla^\perp \psi / r$:

The Green's function analysis gives:
$$|\psi(x)| \lesssim \int \frac{r'^2 |\eta(x')|}{|x - x'|} dx'$$

With the energy bound and Calderon-Zygmund theory:
$$\|\eta\|_{L^p_{\text{weighted}}} \lesssim C$$

for appropriate $p$ and weights determined by $\gamma$.

### 6.2 Constraints on $\eta$ for $\gamma < 1$

**Claim:** If $\gamma < 1$, then $\eta \in L^\infty$ with strong decay at infinity.

**Proof sketch:**
1. Energy bound gives $|U|^2 \sim b^{\gamma - 3}$ in shell
2. Stream function: $|\nabla \psi| \sim r|U| \sim b \cdot b^{(\gamma-3)/2} = b^{(\gamma-1)/2}$
3. For $\gamma < 1$: $|\nabla \psi| \to 0$ at infinity
4. From elliptic theory: $|\Delta^* \psi| \to 0$, hence $r^2 |\eta| \to 0$
5. Therefore $|\eta| \to 0$ at infinity

### 6.3 Ancient Solution Constraint

**Combined with material conservation:**

1. $\eta$ is constant along particle trajectories
2. $\eta$ decays at infinity
3. For ancient solutions, particles trace back to infinity as $t \to -\infty$
4. Therefore: $\eta(x, 0) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \eta(\Phi_t(x), -t) = 0$

This forces $\eta \equiv 0$, hence $\omega^\theta \equiv 0$, hence $U$ is potential flow.

For Euler with no-slip or decay at infinity: potential flow with energy bound forces $U \equiv 0$.

---

## 7. Rigorous Liouville Theorem (Proposed)

### 7.1 Statement

**Theorem (Axisymmetric Euler Liouville):**

Let $U$ be an ancient solution to axisymmetric Euler without swirl in $\mathbb{R}^3 \times (-\infty, 0]$. Suppose:
$$\sup_{b > 0} b^{-\gamma} \int_{B(b)} |U|^2 \, dx < \infty$$
for some $\gamma < 1$.

Then $U \equiv 0$.

### 7.2 Proof Strategy

**Step 1:** Show $\eta = \omega^\theta / r$ decays at infinity.
- Use elliptic estimates on $-\Delta^* \psi = r^2 \eta$
- Energy bound constrains $\psi$ and its derivatives
- Decay of $\psi$ implies decay of $\eta$

**Step 2:** Analyze particle trajectories.
- Energy bound with $\gamma < 1$ implies velocities decay at infinity
- Particles cannot "stay bounded forever" as $t \to -\infty$
- Either particles disperse or compress

**Step 3:** Apply maximum principle.
- If particles disperse: $\eta(x,t) = \eta(\Phi_{-t}(x), 0) \to 0$
- If particles compress: need additional argument (energy bound)

**Step 4:** Conclude $\eta \equiv 0$.
- From Steps 1-3: $\eta$ must vanish
- Then $\omega^\theta = 0$, flow is irrotational
- Irrotational axisymmetric flow with energy bound: $U = 0$

### 7.3 Technical Issues

**Issue 1: Regularity**
- Need $U$ smooth enough for particle trajectories to exist
- Ancient Euler solutions may have lower regularity
- May need to work with distributional solutions

**Issue 2: Axis behavior**
- At $r = 0$, the quantity $\eta = \omega^\theta / r$ requires $\omega^\theta = O(r)$
- This is automatic for smooth axisymmetric fields
- For weak solutions, need careful handling

**Issue 3: Particle trajectory existence**
- For $U \in L^{3,\infty}$, trajectories may not be unique
- Need DiPerna-Lions theory for rough vector fields
- Energy bound may provide enough regularity

## 8. Connection to Type II Blowup Exclusion

### 8.1 The Seregin Framework

Type II blowup with rate $\beta \in (1/2, 3/5)$ leads to:
- Rescaled sequence converging to ancient Euler solution $U$
- Energy bounds of the form $\int_{B(b)} |U|^2 = O(b^\gamma)$ with $\gamma = 2m_1 = 2(2m-1)$

For $m \in (1/2, 3/5)$: $\gamma = 2(2m-1) \in (0, 2/5)$.

**All values satisfy $\gamma < 1$!**

### 8.2 Application

If the Liouville theorem holds with $\gamma < 1$:
1. Any ancient Euler solution from Type II rescaling vanishes: $U = 0$
2. This contradicts the blowup: the rescaled solutions should have non-trivial limit
3. Therefore: Type II blowup cannot occur for $\beta \in (1/2, 3/5)$

### 8.3 The No-Swirl Specialization

The analysis above is for **axisymmetric Euler WITHOUT swirl**.

For the general axisymmetric case (with swirl), the crucial quantity $\Gamma = rU^\theta$ satisfies a more complex equation, and $\eta = \omega^\theta / r$ is not purely transported.

**The no-swirl case is the tractable one.**

Question: Can Type II blowup for NS be restricted to the no-swirl case?
- If initial data has no swirl, the solution remains swirl-free
- Type II blowup starting from no-swirl data would produce ancient Euler without swirl
- Our Liouville theorem would then apply

---

## 9. Summary and Conclusions
